# OpenAI Test

A sample Node that uses LangChain to talk to ChatGPT.

Youâ€™ll need an API key.  So just follow the instructions to
[obtain your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
Save it to the `.env` file as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.  You
can use `.env.template` as a guide to structure your `.env` file.

Install packages, if you haven't already.

```bash
pnpm install
```
